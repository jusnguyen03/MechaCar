# MechaCar

## Project Overview
I will be applying my understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing to analyze a series of datasets from the automotive industry. I will be:
  - load, clean up, and reshape datasets using tidyverse in R.
  - Visualize datasets with basic plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots using ggplot2.
  - Generate and interpret more complex plots such as boxplots and heatmaps using ggplot2.
  - Plot and identify distribution characteristics of a given dataset.
  - Formula- t- e null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given data problem.
  - Implement and evaluate simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models for a given dataset.
  - Implement and evaluate the one-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for a given dataset.
  - Implement and evaluate a chi-squared test for a given dataset.
  - Identify key characteristics of A/B and A/A testing.
  - Determine the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I will be performing a series of statistical tests and create a technical report that provides my interpretation of the findings.

The goals for this challenge are:
  1. Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
  2. Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
  3. Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
  4. Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.
